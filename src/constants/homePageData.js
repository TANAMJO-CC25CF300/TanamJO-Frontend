For example, ladybugs and lacewings are natural predators of aphids. You can plant flowers like marigold and dill to attract them. Additionally, companion plants such as basil and garlic can help repel certain pests from tomatoes. By planting a variety of crops, you create an environment that is less hospitable to pests but supports tomato growth.\n\nMaintaining garden cleanliness by regularly pruning wilted leaves and removing plant debris can also prevent pest populations from growing. Using natural traps like yellow sticky traps is effective for reducing flying insect pests. Always monitor your plants regularly so pest attacks can be detected early. By observing pest attack patterns, you can determine the right time to take control measures.`

A mixture of water, liquid soap, and a little vegetable oil can be used to control aphids. Garlic and chili extracts are also effective for repelling small insects. Always test the solution on a small part of the plant before applying it thoroughly. Using organic mulch can also prevent soil pests from breeding and help retain soil moisture.\n\nYou can also use compost and organic fertilizers to strengthen plant resistance to pest attacks. Healthy and strong plants are more resistant to diseases and pests. Crop rotation each planting season can break the life cycle of certain pests, preventing their populations from increasing drastically. You can also try making neem oil solution as a natural pesticide that is safe for plants and the environment.`
